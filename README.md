# ObesityPrediction
Objective
According to the CDC, the prevalence of obesity is 42.5% among adults aged from 20 and older.
Thus, we wanted to create a model that can predict the obesity levels of individuals based on eating habits and physical conditions.

Data Source
This dataset belongs to the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data was gathered from individuals from Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Each entry describes the individualâ€™s eating habits and physical condition and is labeled with the class variable NObesity (Obesity Level). This data set used 7 different categories of obesity levels which are:
1. Insufficient Weight
2. Normal Weight
3. Overweight Level I,
4. Overweight Level II,
5. Obesity Type I,
6. Obesity Type II
7. Obesity Type III.

Conclusion
- The model made with the highest accuracy label was trained with the tree based algorithm.
- Our model is able to predict obesity levels based on eating habits and physical conditions with an accuracy of 94%.
